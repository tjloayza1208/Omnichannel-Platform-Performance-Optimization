## Background
The Omnichannel Platform, a critical system for the bank's digital operations, faced severe performance limitations, handling only 30 transactions per second (TPS). This caused significant service disruptions during customer migration.
## Challenges
- Limited system capacity of 30 TPS, causing customer dissatisfaction.
- Performance improvements need to be balanced with minimal service disruption.
- Scaling the platform for long-term growth.
## Goals
- Achieve a transaction capacity of 80 TPS to resume customer migration.
- Enhance the platformâ€™s scalability for future demands, targeting 250 TPS.
## Solution Overview
The project was divided into three key milestones:
1. **Immediate Bottleneck Resolution:** Achieved 80 TPS to resume customer migration.
2. **Endpoint Optimization:** Enhanced web service efficiency and stability.
3. **Core Platform Overhaul:** Implemented substantial architectural changes, reaching 250 TPS.
## Milestones
1. **Milestone 1:** Diagnosed and resolved bottlenecks to achieve 80 TPS.
2. **Milestone 2:** Optimized endpoint configurations for web services.
3. **Milestone 3:** Overhauled platform architecture, enabling 250 TPS and launching a new Mobile Banking version.
## Results
- Increased system capacity from 30 TPS to 250 TPS.
- Resumed customer migration ahead of schedule after reaching 80 TPS.
- Established updated operational procedures for sustained performance.
## Skills Demonstrated
- IT architecture and system optimization
- Performance tuning and scalability
- Stakeholder communication and project management
- Web service endpoint optimization
- Capacity planning and quality assurance
## Key Takeaways
This project reinforced the importance of a phased approach to solving critical performance challenges, stakeholder collaboration, and continuous monitoring for sustained success.
